# Medal Awards Loop
 In this exercise, I've crafted a for loop using the counter variable i, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration until i is less than or equal to 10.

Within the loop, I've implemented an if-else statement to handle different conditions:

If the value of i is 1, it logs "Gold medal."
If the value of i is 2, it logs "Silver medal."
If the value of i is 3, it logs "Bronze medal."
For all remaining values of i, it logs just the value of i.
